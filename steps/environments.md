## Acorn environments

Acorn provides 2 environments so you can develop, build and distribute your Acorn application:

- first option: an OSS Acorn runtime you can install on your own cluster

Follow these instructions to [get started with Acorn OSS on your own](./environment-local.md)  

- second option: an online platform where we can use a sandbox environment to start right away the development of an application for free

Follow these instuctions to deploy your application on Acorn Saas platform](./environment-saas.md)

Note: in this workshop we will mainly illustrate the usage of the Saas Platform (option 2) but you can use your own cluster (option 1) if you prefer
